        <h3>Sharing Photography - A SmugMug Review</h3>
        <img class="u-pull-center" src="images/collage-960x192.jpg"/>
        <p class="buffer">Upload, host and share your priceless photos in a style you want, while every original is safe and secure. Don't let Social Media down-sample your brilliant photos and thus ruin your visual legacy.</p>
        <p>I was a basic user for years, but recently upgraded to Power for deep customisation and a custom domain, without paying for the commerce options I'll never need.</p>
        <p>There are 4 user account tiers; <strong>Basic, Power, Portfolio &amp; Business</strong>. I cover the best features below.</p>

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_22.png"/>Unlimited Storage</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Exactly what it means, unlimited uploads &amp; storage. Though, SmugMug does say &quot;within reason&quot;. Accepted file types are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. The current size limitations are 50 megabytes and 100 megapixels. Anything over, they will re-sample it. The SmugVault paid add-on will accept all file types and images up to 3 gigabytes each.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_79.png"/>Fully Customisable</h4>
        <p><strong>Power, Portfolio &amp; Business accounts</strong></p>
        <p>This is why I have the SmugMug Power plan. Basic users can customise their homepage, but not full freedom customisation like Power plans and above. The super simple drag-and-drop system makes it very easy to design without any code. Of course all users can switch between any theme as they wish. Just pick your favourite theme and start there. There is no 3rd party Javascript, but add as much custom css as you like.</p>

      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_64.png"/>Custom Domain</h4>
        <p><strong>Power, Portfolio &amp; Business accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Use your very own domain name, up to 50 characters max. It's as simple as setting up a CNAME and domain forwarding with your registrar. It's worth considering one of the new generic top-level domains (gTLD), such as .pics .photo .photos and .photography.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_66.png"/>Responsive Layout</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>A passive feature. At least a quarter of your traffic will be from a mobile device these days. A responsive website is imperative to provide all visitors an optimal viewing experience.</p>

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_01.png"/>Easy Sharing</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Share to Social Media, a forum, send an email, or simply get a link for any image, album or folder. There is a specific publish to Facebook feature for albums as well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_78.png"/>Simple Organisation</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Simply drag and drop photos, folders or galleries within the organiser, just like your computer. There's many sort options, or just click and drag the order you want. You can have up to 5 levels deep of folders, though I haven't gone past 3 levels with well over 5000 photos.</p>

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_40.png"/>Always Live, Always Fast</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>I signed up for a Standard Pingdom account for 3 months and had it monitor various sites, on various hosting platforms. SmugMug was consistently the best, outperforming sites on expensive VPS plans. Pingdom reported 5 miniscule outages with 99.97% uptime and 873ms response time.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_23.png"/>Safe &amp; Secure</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) stores and backs up every image and video, with multiple redundancy. Content is now delivered online with CloudFlare for added speed and security. SmugMug is much more reliable than backing up with removable media. It's easy for owners to download original photos or whole albums at any time.</p>

    <div class="row spacemed">
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_77.png"/>Camera Awesome App</h4>
        <p><strong>Available for everyone with an iPhone, iPad or Android</strong></p>
        <p>Probably one of the best camera apps I’ve seen. 1-Tap share to major Social Networks and your own SmugMug site (thus built by SmugMug). Free to download, but offers many more presets, filters, textures and frames as in-app purchases. #Awesomized.</p>

      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_27.png"/>SmugMug App</h4>
        <p><strong>All users with an iPhone, iPad or Android</strong></p>
        <p>A great addition to use with your SmugMug website. Upload all your photos and videos for sharing and secure backing up. Save galleries for offline viewing or mark them as favorites for quick access.</p>

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_83.png"/>HD Video</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Upload nice and sharp high definition video. Supports true HD, 1920 x 1080 pixels. Can be up to 20 minutes in length and 3 gigabytes in size. I’ll be honest here, the playback hasn’t been that great in my experience (speed 7-9mb/s). SmugMug have a YouTube hosted video on their own homepage and support page, not a great look if they host video themselves.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_24.png"/>Privacy at Your Control</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Password protect any folder, album or even your entire site. Use different passwords with password hints. An easy question that all your friends would know is a great way to keep out most strangers if that’s a concern. Right-click protection is a neat feature, but is only available for power users and above.</p>

    <div class="row spacemed">

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_25.png"/>Commerce</h4>
        <p><strong>Portfolio &amp; Business accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Not my forte I must say, but I reckon you won't be disappointed if that's your thing. Supposedly used by thousands upon thousands of professionals worldwide. Why on Earth would you pay an expensive web design company when you could easily do it all yourself!? Business users also get custom pricelists, and can setup a password for an assistant that has less account privilages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_11.png"/>Super Hero Support</h4>
        <p><strong>All user accounts</strong></p>
        <p>Their support staff are called 'Support Heroes', and have avatars to suit. The best thing is, there is no support dashboard, all you do is email 1 standard help email address. Their response times are honestly outstanding 24/7, and quality of support is very good. Once or twice when they didn't quite read my email properly at first. I guess they are only human after all.</p>

        <h4><img class="icons" src="images/icon_50_80.png"/>Forum Community</h4>
        <p><strong>Available for everyone</strong></p>
        <p>Digital Grin, or dgrin.com forums has been around almost as long as Google. Mix with other photographers and share your gear, finishing techniques, photos, website etc etc. Also great for SmugMug support, especially SmugMug customisation.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Obviously I think SmugMug overall is pretty awesome. They did hit a rough patch in August 2012, when they increased prices for some customers by 67% then released the long awaited 'new' SmugMug some 11 months later. I'm sure they've learnt some lessons during that fiasco. Anyway, SmugMug was founded in 2002, that's a wealth of time and experience delivering photos on the web.</p>
        <p>Since the release of the 'new' SmugMug, it's been nothing but popular. They've left no stone unturned, and I'm still finding nifty little features in the back end.</p>
